# Theory of Primordial Field (Chaos Field)

Implementation of the groundbreaking cosmological theory proposing the universe's emergence from a dynamic annihilation state of "Nothingness."

## Key Features
- Violent Derivation Operator √õŒ∂
- Survival Criterion ùíüŒ±
- Gauge Group Emergence
- Running Coupling with Chaos Correction

## Predictions
- **ŒºH Lamb shift**: 8.221 ¬± 0.002 meV (2025 experimental test)
- **CKM matrix elements**: |Vus| = 0.2250 ¬± 0.0002
- **Strong coupling constant**: Œ±s(Mz) = 0.11820

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/The-Original-Field-Theory.git
cd The-Original-Field-Theory
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/predictions/lamb_shift.py
